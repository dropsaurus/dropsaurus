I'm neil, a designer and developer crafting fast, clean systems while studying at nyu. Drawing inspiration from new york city's dynamic energy and architectural minimalism, I build digital experiences that prioritize simplicity without sacrificing functionality. I love exploring the city's hidden corners, finding beauty in the elegant solutions that make this intricate metropolis function.
